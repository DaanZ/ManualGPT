Check the NC program for proper execution before you use it for actual operation.
Check the parameters for proper execution before you use them for actual operation.
Always confirm safety at the destination node before you transfer an NC program from 
CNC Operator.
The devices or machines may perform unexpected operations regardless of the operating 
mode of the CPU Unit.
If you disconnect the USB dongle during operation, CNC Operator stops operating. In the 
controller program, configure a control circuit to safely stop the system even if CNC Opera-
tor stops operating. For example, it should execute heartbeat processing between CNC 
Operator and the controller, and stop the system when the heartbeat is lost. Accidents may 
occur if the system performs unexpected operations. For the detailed heartbeat configura-
tion method, refer to A-3 Heartbeat Configuration Example on page A-7.
WARNING
11
  Safety Precautions
CNC Operator Operation Manual (O032)
 
Although the Simulator simulates the operation of the Controller, there are difference from 
the Controller in operation and timing.
After you debug the user program on the Simulator, always check operations on the physi-
cal Controller before you use the user program to operate the controlled system.
Accidents may occur if the system performs unexpected operations.
Always confirm safety before you reset the system.
Always confirm safety at the destination node before you transfer an NC program to a 
node.
Not doing so may result in injury.
Caution
   Precautions for Safe Use
12
CNC Operator Operation Manual (O032)
Precautions for Safe Use
• Confirm that no adverse effect will occur in the system before you attempt any of the following.
• Changing operating modes (edit, MANUAL AUTO, MDI) by CNC Operator, including operating 
mode setting upon power-ON.
• Changing NC program or settings (tool offset, work offset, CNC motor compensation table, etc.)
• When changing a CNC motor compensation table data in the CPU Unit, store the data on the 
retained type memory or save it to a file, so that the data will be loaded when the power is turned ON 
again. Otherwise, the previous status will be restored when the power is turned on again, which may 
cause an unexpected machine operation to occur.
• Confirm the target coordinate system and axis number carefully before you run manual operation 
(jog, spindle operation).
• Manual operation (jog, spindle operation) involves motor operation. Refer to the operation manual 
before you run manual operation. 
Be particularly careful of the following points.
• Confirm safety around all moving parts.
• When you click the Run button, the motor begins actual operation at the specified speed. Only 
begin motor operation if you are absolutely sure there is no danger if you start the motor.
• Always have an external emergency stop device available.
• Sometimes you may be unable to stop the motor from your computer. Install an external emer-
gency stop device so that you can stop the motor immediately if needed.
• Operate the motor only when you can clearly confirm the motor operation so that you can react 
quickly in the case of any danger that may arise due to operation of the motor.
• A communications error will occur if you attempt to begin operations without EtherCAT communi-
cations. Always establish EtherCAT communications first.
• Be aware of all the precautions that you need to take during manual operation.
• During manual operation, only the tool has any control of the operation. Any commands from 
motion control instructions or CNC control instructions are ignored.
If communications are interrupted between the CNC Operator and Controller during test run operations, 
you will not be able to stop the motor from the computer. Provide an external hardware means that you 
can use to stop the motor without fail.
• Executing Feed Hold Reset automatically returns the system to the feed hold stop position at rapid 
feed. Confirm that there are no obstacles on the return path before you execute Feed Hold Reset.

  Precautions for Correct Use
CNC Operator Operation Manual (O032)
Precautions for Correct Use
• Observe the following precautions when you start CNC Operator.
• Exit all applications that are not necessary to use CNC Operator. For virus checker or other soft-
ware that could affect the startup and operations of CNC Operator, take measures such as to 
remove CNC Operator from the scope of virus checking.
• If any hard disks or printers that are connected to the computer are shared with other computers 
on a network, isolate them so that they are no longer shared.
• With some notebook computers, the default settings do not supply power to Ethernet port to save 
energy. There are energy-saving settings in Windows, and also sometimes in utilities or the BIOS 
of the computer. Refer to the user documentation for your computer and disable all energy-saving 
features.
• When a change is made in the ini file, check that it will not affect facilities before starting CNC 
Operator.
• Securely confirm program operations in the project, main program, sub program, and connected 
controller sides before starting the actual application system.
• While CNC Operator is running, be careful of the following points.
• Do not exit CNC Operator while the equipment is running.
• Do not download the NC program from CNC Operator while the NC program is running.

3-6-3  NC Subprograms
CNC Operator handles NC subprograms in the following way.
• Each NC subprogram must be saved in one file. Specify the program number by adding "o" to the top 
line of the subprogram.
• Specify program numbers 3000 to 9999 for NC subprograms handled by CNC Operator. Other num-
bers cause an error during the parse process.
• The default location (folder) of NC subprograms is as follows:
 <Name of the HDD with Windows installed>:\OMRON\NC
The location can be changed by editing the SubProgramFolder entry in the NC Files section of the 
CNCOperator.ini file.
• NC subprogram files have .nc extension.
The saved subprogram is added to the main program by specifying the program number with the M98 
command and parsing the program in the NC program (main program). For details on the M98 com-
mand, refer to the NJ/NY-series G code Instruction Reference Manual (Cat. No. O031).
Example: Specifying an NC subprogram that was saved with NC subprogram number 3000 from the 
main program
• NC program (main program)
M98 p3000
M30
• NC Subprograms
o3000
G1 X100 Y100
M99
Precautions for Correct Use
An NC subprogram can be parsed by the G code editor after it is invoked to and assigned with 
the main program with the M98 command. NC subprograms that are not invoked from the main 
program cannot be parsed.
In the same way, the NC subprogram transferred directly from Sysmac Studio to the controller 
is also untargeted for parse processing.
Only NC subprograms that can be invoked from the NC program (main program) can be edited after 
verification is conducted.
1
Save the NC subprogram to be invoked to the NC subprogram folder.
2
Add the code (M98) used to invoke the NC subprogram from the main program, and parse the 
subprogram in the full screen editor.

3-11 Starting from the Sysmac Studio
You can start CNC Operator from Sysmac Studio. When CNC Operator is started from Sysmac Studio, 
the CNC coordinate system, CNC motor, CNC motor compensation table, destination’s IP address, and 
FTP setting configured by Sysmac Studio are transferred to CNC Operator through the configuration 
file. This helps save time as the motor axis and coordinate system settings do not need to be config-
ured again on CNC Operator.
The following shows the procedure to inherit the CNC settings from Sysmac Studio and start CNC 
Operator.
1
Start Sysmac Studio and configure the CNC settings.
Precautions for Correct Use
If the CNC coordinate system settings are not configured, the following error occurs and Sys-
mac CNC Operator cannot be started.
2
Select Tool -> Launch External Application -> CNC Operator.
3
Specify the CNC coordinate system to inherit and the path where CNC Operator is installed, 
then press the OK button.
Precautions for Correct Use
When settings are inherited from Sysmac Studio on Windows installed in the NY-series CNC 
Controller before CNC Operator is started, the IP address specified by Sysmac Studio is not 
inherited. Manually specify the IP address of CNC Operator. The default IP address is 
192.168.254.1.

CNC Operator performs data exchange with the sequence control program by reading and writing vari-
ables registered in the CNC Controller via EtherNet/IP message communications.
CNC Operator uses the SYSMAC Gateway communications middleware for EtherNet/IP message 
communications.
This section describes SYSMAC Gateway settings required to establish a communication between 
CNC Operator and CNC Controller.
Refer to the online help for details on SYSMAC Gateway. You can access the online help by implement-
ing the following procedure.
• From the Windows Start menu, select All Programs - OMRON - Sysmac Gateway - Sysmac Gate-
way Help.
Precautions for Correct Use
• If CNC Operator cannot be connected to the CNC Controller, check that the SYSMAC Gate-
way communication service is started and that the Ethernet network port is opened.
• While CNC Operator is connected to the CNC Controller, do not stop the SYSMAC Gateway 
communication service and do not close the Ethernet network port.
• If the connection cannot be established even though the Ethernet network port is open, 
check the following:
a) the IP address of the destination is correct
b) the power to the Controller is turned ON
c) the cable is correctly connected
d) hubs or other network devices are not malfunctioning
e) settings of the SYSMAC Gateway Ethernet network port are correct
f) the Windows firewall software is not blocking communication packets

A-3 Heartbeat Configuration Example
When creating an original sequence control program to transfer data mutually between the CNC Con-
troller and CNC Operator, configure the sequence control program and CNC Operator program (when 
using Software Development Kit), taking heartbeats into account.
The following example shows a control circuit to stop the device safely even if CNC Operator stops in 
the sequence control program. The control circuit performs heartbeat processing between CNC Opera-
tor and CNC Controller, and stops the device if heartbeats are lost.
On the CNC Controller’s ladder program, configure a circuit to monitor the ON/OFF state of a specific 
bool value variable at the specified interval (example: 5 sec.). In this example, wHeartBeatSig and wIn-
vHeartBeatSig are monitored by AccumulationTimer. If a monitoring error (timeout) occurs, the speci-
fied bool value variable is set to ON to notify CNC Operator of the error.
Describe a circuit to stop the machine safely, for example, to stop all axes when above mentioned vari-
able is ON.

The following example shows a case of creating a heartbeat configuration application program using 
CNC Operator Software Development Kit. The specific bool value variable indicating the timeout is read 
at the specified intervals. If the bool value is set to ON, the program notifies the user of a timeout error.
// Variable reading setting at specified interval
            this.heartbeatTimer = new Timer(1000); // 1 second timer
            this.heartbeatTimer.Elapsed += this.OnHeartbeatElapsed;
// Variable reading and update processing
